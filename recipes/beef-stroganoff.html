        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>What Is Beef Stroganoff?</h3>
        <p>Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the Stroganov family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles.</p>
        <h3>What Makes This Recipe So 'Simple?'</h3>
