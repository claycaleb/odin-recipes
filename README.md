# odin-recipes

This project is modeled after the [Recipes project from The Odin Project's 
Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

Updated style after completing the [Intro to CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-intro-to-css) and [The Cascade](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-the-cascade) lessons.

These skills are demonstrated:

- HTML structure and syntax
- Use of links, images, and ordered and unordered lists
- Git commands and commit messages
- CSS style
